# Brawl-Stars-v30
Python Brawl Stars server emulator for version 30 based on Classic Brawl

### Requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- colorama

### Running the server
In a terminal, type __`pip install -r requirements.txt`__ then run the server using __`python Main.py`__

### Running Server in Android
Download PyDroid 3 and install the requirements and then run server using __`main.py`__ and click on the "_" button and run the game.

### Configuring the client app
To connect to your server, a **patched client** is required. Download this [base APK](https://mega.nz/file/XSBCHJrD#oj7KVqFRtVnsC9IZNZk0ap7Jn7yGbP0Zug4NSI8-kCA) and change the IP in `libmg.config.so`.

### Battles
Offline Battles are enabled so you can press PLAY and start playing. Unfortunately offline logic is kinda broken.

### Credit
Thanks to ShockWave for making v30 Client and S.B for sqlite3 database.
